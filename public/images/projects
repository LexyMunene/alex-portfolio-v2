I understand that you want to build a new portfolio from scratch, avoiding outdated and incompatible technologies. Let's break down the process into manageable steps. Hereâ€™s a general outline of what we can do:

### 1. **Define the Structure and Content**
   - **Sections**: Identify the main sections you want in your portfolio (e.g., Hero, About, Projects, Experience, Testimonials, Contact).
   - **Content**: Gather the content you want to display in each section, including text, images, and links.

### 2. **Choose the Technology Stack**
   - **Framework**: Decide whether to stick with Next.js or choose another framework (e.g., Gatsby, React).
   - **Styling**: Consider using modern CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS or styled-components for styling.
   - **State Management**: If needed, decide on a state management solution (e.g., React Context, Redux).

### 3. **Set Up the Project**
   - Initialize a new project using your chosen framework.
   - Set up the necessary dependencies (e.g., React, Tailwind CSS).

### 4. **Create Components**
   - Build reusable components for each section of your portfolio.
   - Ensure components are responsive and accessible.

### 5. **Implement Routing**
   - If your portfolio has multiple pages, set up routing to navigate between them.

### 6. **Deploy the Portfolio**
   - Choose a hosting platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify) for deployment.
   - Ensure that the deployment process is smooth and that there are no compatibility issues.

### 7. **Testing and Optimization**
   - Test the portfolio on different devices and browsers.
   - Optimize for performance and SEO.

### 8. **Iterate and Improve**
   - Gather feedback and make improvements based on user experience.
