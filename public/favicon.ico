I understand that you want to build a new portfolio from scratch, avoiding outdated and incompatible technologies or practices that were present in your previous project. Let's go through the key components of your existing portfolio to identify what worked well and what can be improved or replaced in the new version.

### Key Components of Your Existing Portfolio

1. **Next.js Framework**: Your portfolio is built using Next.js, which is a great choice for server-side rendering and static site generation. We can continue using Next.js for the new portfolio.

2. **React Components**: You have a modular structure with various components like `Hero`, `Grid`, `Footer`, `Experience`, etc. This is a good practice as it promotes reusability and maintainability.

3. **Styling**: You used Tailwind CSS for styling, which is modern and efficient for building responsive designs. We can continue using Tailwind CSS or explore alternatives like CSS Modules or styled-components if desired.

4. **Animations and Effects**: You incorporated animations using libraries like Framer Motion. This adds a nice touch to the user experience. We can keep this approach or explore other animation libraries.

5. **Dark Mode Support**: Your portfolio has a theme provider for dark mode, which is a great feature. We can implement this in the new portfolio as well.

6. **Data Management**: You used local data files (like `data.js`) for managing content. We can consider using a headless CMS or a static site generator for better content management.

7. **Accessibility**: Ensure that the new portfolio adheres to accessibility standards, which is crucial for reaching a wider audience.

### Steps to Build a New Portfolio

1. **Set Up the Project**:
   - Create a new Next.js project using the latest version.
   - Install Tailwind CSS and configure it properly.

2. **Component Structure**:
   - Define a clear component structure similar to your previous portfolio but with improvements based on your experience.
   - Create reusable components for sections like `Hero`, `Projects`, `Experience`, `Testimonials`, and `Footer`.

3. **Styling**:
   - Use Tailwind CSS for styling, ensuring that the design is responsive and modern.
   - Consider implementing CSS variables for theming.

4. **Animations**:
   - Use Framer Motion or another animation library to add smooth transitions and effects.

5. **Content Management**:
   - Decide whether to use local data files or a headless CMS for managing content.
   - If using a CMS, set up the necessary API calls to fetch data.

6. **Accessibility**:
   - Ensure that all components are accessible, using semantic HTML and ARIA attributes where necessary.

7. **Testing and Deployment**:
   - Test the portfolio across different devices and browsers.
   - Deploy the portfolio using Vercel or another hosting provider.
